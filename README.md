# TinyVGG
This project demonstrates the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch for image classification tasks. The CNN architecture used in this project is a simplified version of the VGG network called TinyVGG. The project uses a modular layout for easier modifying and inspecting the code. Currently, files are in persistent storage in Google Drive.

Currently, the project covers ML aspects like:
- data preparation,
- data analysis,
- training and testing models,
- modular format,
- predictions,
- transfer learning,
- evaluation
